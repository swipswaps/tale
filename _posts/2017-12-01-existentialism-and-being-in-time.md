**Da-sein** i.e, 'Existence of a person in its own presence', is one of the most powerful philosophical fields which is firmly dependent on the psychological perceptions of an individual.

**Hey Guys!**, being interested in the field that exists on the boundary of **Materialistic-Metaphysics** and **Existentialism**, I'm always ready to learn new theories. Trying to interpret it in my ways is the best part of it. Recently, I started reading about Martin Heidegger's philosophical theories arguing on the very presence(existence) in time and being of an individual. I faced some interesting theories and In this post I will try to create my own opinions around the widly spread rational thoughts of Heidegger. **"I may not agree with what you think, believe or say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it."**

Since the very beginning, I was always intrigued about determining my existence and still trying to answer some of  questions on the very foundations of my life; the true meaning, the last purpose, or the uncategorizable value of Life. In psychotherapeutic terms, it is known as **existencial crisis**, which isn't related to any actue depression syndrome or state, just to be clear.

Martin Heidegger's way of questioning is more accurately aimed then the Hawkeye's arrow shot (Not a fan of J.Renner!). If you are interested in philosophy you must know have heard about **Martin Heidegger**, a German philosopher and widely acknowledged as one of the most original and important philosophers. He proposed some majorly appreciated concepts aiming at the very existence in time, he called it **'Being and Time'**. In Martin's words 'being' by asking about the being for whom Being is a question, which is indeed 'Da-sein'. Heidegger wanted to write about the history of philosophy—that is, the evolution of philosophy by re-tracing its history, unfortunately he never completed this work.

### So, Let's discuss what is **Existentialism.** 

Wikipedia says, it a theory in philosophy or approach which emphasizes the existence of the individual person as a free and responsible agent determining their own development through acts of the will. But, I think these type of statements are for a 15-year-old kiddo taking his first lecture on philosophy and also anyone can edit Wiki so who cares! 

**Existentialism**, in my opinion, is a field which gets irreversibly harder and harder as you keep on researching and investing your time in it (even its definition raised questions on the definition of definition).

I won't say it will be easy to understand but let's try to define it with some precise statements. Let's see 'What Existentialism is not?'
It has no implication with wealth, pleasure, honor, good life, social values, or having the "society's are retarded" or “It is not my fault!” mentality. It essentially is about your free will, your life choices, the decision you took in the peace, the futility of your worldly desire, the discipline of the life. **'Existentialistic Ideas'** rose when humans saw their society and surrounding aiming towards their existence, the Great Depression, World War. The light of optimism in the society which was erased by the calamities.

Martin Heidegger's _'Being and time'_, is about the existence in the time of your own self. In the factical existence, any particular presence either ‘has the time’ or ‘does not have it’. Did you get what it means? It means that either one ‘takes time’ for something or ‘cannot allow any time for it’. Why does Da-sein, an aura of existence ‘take time’, and why can it ‘lose’ it? Where does it take time from? How is this time related to Dasein’s temporality? Martin asks these questions in his book 'Being and Time'.

Martin's views are hard to summarize since every Da-sein can be uniquely interpreted and it depends upon the understanding of 'being', which itself is a determination of being of Da-sein. He states that Da-sein exists as an entity such that in its Being, that Being is itself an issue. As care that is, as existing in the unity of the time in its own presence, which has been characterized as a “there”. As being with others, which has been formed in discourse and expressed in language. "Being there/here" will be semantically similar to the movement of dasein through time.

 >"Being-in-the-world has always expressed itself, and as Being alongside entities encountered within-the-world, it constantly expresses itself in addressing itself to the very object of its concern and discussing it." <cite>&mdash; Martin Heidegger</cite>

After being engulfed in the virtual, non-existent, materialistic world of Heidegger's 'Being and Time', the only thing that I can for sure is that - **“Everyone is the other and no one is himself.”**
