I still remember the day I realized that life is beautiful, just by looking at the sky above, completely ignoring that I had an exam after that, which I totally messed up.  

Having interest in Astrophysics, I have read about the level up to which our science tries to answer the fundamental question of life, but the fact that the Universe has always managed to exist with its bright presence has always intr.... no, I won't give you a philosophical lecture on the nature of Universe or any theory about it.


This is a <strong>poem</strong> which revolves around such thought. Its name is <strong>'Still glad to be a part of Universe!'</strong>, if you don't know in case I am sure you are blind because it is written in 56 wide pixels at the top. 

<br>

Open your eyes and see that star,<br>
Close to me, may look so far. <br>
Would be feeling neat to be such bright,<br>
Entrapped within darkness, still creating light. <br>
He is dying slowly, lying above, <br>
Must be around someone he love. <br>
Must be burning within, engulfed in some curse, <br><br>
Still glad to be a part of Universe! <br>

<br>
Open your eyes and see that line, <br>
Some star just died, but left behind this shine. <br>
Looks satisfied, must have fulfilled many wishes, <br>
Will live forever over some canvas, in some brushes. <br>
"Gifted the sky, a life of proud", <br>
Cried a person in the crowd. <br>
Must be crying within, reciting the verse, <br><br>
Still glad to be a part of Universe! <br>

<br>
Open your eyes and see that constellation, <br>
A magnificient form implying doubts on its creation. <br>
Joining the illuminous dots, Is this even real? <br>
Appears to be coincidence, a form of surreal. <br>
May have been caused by fate, maybe by chance, <br>
Seems to be holding the glance of dance. <br>
Perhaps crying over their shoulders in terse, <br><br>
Still glad to be a part of Universe! <br>
<hr style="opacity: 0.1;">
<br>
Open your eyes and imagine beyond the light, <br>
Beyond the darkness, beyond the empty space, beyond the dark night. <br>
Imagine the creation, of the matter, <br>
Trapped within a point which then scramble and scatter. <br>
Imagine our existence in this fabric of motion, <br>
How tiny our problems are, in this unimaginable ocean? <br>
Must be upset lying beyond, couldn't get worse, <br><br>
Still glad to be a part of Universe! <br>
