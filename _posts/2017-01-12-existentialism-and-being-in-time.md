The Existence of a person in its own presence, i.e **Da-sein** is one of the powerful philosophical fields, firmly dependent on the psychological perceptions of an individual.

_Hey Guys!_ I've been interested in the field that exists on the boundary of **'Materialistic Metaphysics and Existentialism'**. I am still studying and been interpreting my ways in this field of art. _"I may not agree with what you think, believe and say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it."_

Since the very beginning, I was always intrigued about determining my existence and thinking and trying to answer about questions on the very foundations of my life, the true meaning, the last purpose, or uncategorizable value of these days. In psychotherapeutic terms, it is known as **Existence crisis**, but I wasn't in a depression, that I know for sure(hah! ducked it!).

Martin Heidegger said 
> “Every questioning is a seeking. Every seeking takes its direction beforehand from what is sought. Questioning is a knowing search for beings in their thatness and whatness.”

If you are interested in philosophy you must know about, **Martin Heidegger**, a German philosopher and widely acknowledged to be one of the most original and important philosophers proposed some widely appreciated concepts aiming at the very existence in time, he called it **'Being and Time'**. More precisely, in Martin's words 'being' by asking about the being for whom Being is a question. He said this 'Da-Sein'. Heidegger's wanted to write about the history of philosophy—that is, the evolution of philosophy by re-tracing its history, unfortunately he never completed this work.

### So, Let's discuss what is **Existentialism.** 

Wikipedia calls, it a theory in philosophy or approach which emphasizes the existence of the individual person as a free and responsible agent determining their own development through acts of the will. But in my thought, these types of definitions are formal and for a 15-year-old boy taking his first lecture on philosophy. 

What I believe is, _**'Existentialism'**_ is a field which gets irreversibly harder and harder as you keep on researching and invest your time in it.(Even its definition raised questions on the definition of definition).

I won't say it will be easy to understand but let's try to define it at some higher levels. _What Existentialism is not?_
It has no implication with wealth, pleasure, honor, good life, social values, society's are retarded or having the “It is not my fault!” mentality. It is about your free will, your life choices, the decision you took in the peace, the futility of your worldly desire, the discipline of the life. **'Existentialistic Ideas'** rise when humans saw their society and surrounding aiming towards their existence, the Great Depression, World War. The light of optimism in the society which was erased by the calamities.

Martin Heidegger's _'Being and time'_, is about the existence in the time of your own self. In the factical existence, any particular presence either ‘has the time’ or ‘does not have it’. What does it mean? It means that either one ‘takes time’ for something or ‘cannot allow any time for it’. Why does Da-sein, an aura of existence ‘take time’, and why can it ‘lose’ it? Where does it take time from? How is this time related to Dasein’s temporality?, Martin asks these questions in his book 'Being and Time'. Martin's views on these are more dedicated to the field of cognitive metaphysics and evolutionary philosophy in psychology.

Martin's views are hard to summarize since every Da-sein can be uniquely interpreted and it depends upon an understanding of being, which itself is a determination of being of Da-sein. Martin clearly speaks that Da-sein exists as an entity such that in its Being, that Being is itself an issue. As care that is, as existing in the unity of the time in its own presence, which has been fallingly thrown, which is characterized as a “there”. As being with others, which has been formed in discourse and expressed in language.
 >"Being-in-the-world has always expressed itself, and as Being alongside entities encountered within-the-world, it constantly expresses itself in addressing itself to the very object of its concern and discussing it." <cite>&mdash; Martin Heidegger</cite>

Being engulfed in the virtual non-existent materialistic world of Martin Heidegger's 'Being and Time', the only thing that I can for sure is that - **“Everyone is the other and no one is himself.”**
