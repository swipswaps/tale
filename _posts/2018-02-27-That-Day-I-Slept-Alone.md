A few weeks ago I met a girl, after some minutes in the conversation I get to know that she likes to write and also beautifully. She asked me that why don't I write? I didn't know what should I say, it was a sensible thing to listen to. Later that day I asked myself the same question since I do like English literature, and at some levels can feel the essence of poetry; the artistic nature of words always bedazzled me. From that day, I started to write what I felt is something to be expressed with words. This poem is a subtle consequence of it.

<br>

I went to meet them all,<br>
Some from months, some from a fall. <br>
Hugged some, talked to a few, <br>
About some plans to be made, some plans due. <br>
Asked well-being of them and their wives,<br>
Listened to some happy memories of their lives. <br>
Shared some happiness of my own. <br>

That day I slept alone. <br>

<br>
I went to the ocean once, <br>
Stopped between the waters, waters amongst.   <br>
Listened to the sound of curling sway,  <br>
Cried a little, with the wind halfway.  <br>
Touched the light rays from twilight, <br>
Dead silence throughout, with souls lifelike. <br>
Among the nature, felt like an unknown. <br>

That day I slept alone. <br>

<br>
I went to see my rich fellow, <br>
Friendly nature but from heart a little shallow. <br>
Looked at his bungalow and luxurious cars, <br>
Drank an old champagne in splendid bars. <br>
Listened to stories where nothing is expensive, <br>
Money meant everything, About which they're all pensive. <br>
He was sittin' on a chair, dreamin' about a throne. <br>

That day I slept alone. <br>
<hr style="opacity: 0.1;">
<br>
I went through streets one day, <br>
A quarter before dusk, mid-summer in may. <br>
Saw a crippled old beggar, with an empty bowl, <br>
Wearing a shredded jacket on a ripped soul. <br>
His an-year old son was sitting in his lap, <br>
Playing with the sounds of movement, the sound of clap. <br>
His pleasure was delightful, eyes glittering like gem-stone. <br>

That day I slept alone. <br>
