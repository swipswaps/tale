I subscribed the youtube channels of X-factor UK/USA and Got talent shows a long time ago but recently I accidently watched one of audition-video and I was so intrigued of the vocals. It just fired up one of my neurons located at the craziest part of my brain, whom advice I most certainly take (He knows that). Hence begin the 46 hrs hunt of all the possible audition videos, 6-chair auditions, boot camp, got talent singers, their past records and if their vocals are really relevant, I researched about them. In this Blog-post I'll tell my experience of some of the most gifted and well practised singers, some soulful song writers and brilliant stories about them that I found out.

I will try to put it as interestingly as possible and I think if you are music fan or soulful song appreciator or any random person surfing through internet then I guess this 8-minute read is for you.

The First person whose vocals I'm grateful to hear is 'Reuben Gray'. This young 16-years old boy sang a song about an apology to his girlfriend when she dumped him and the good thing is, they patched up and she is sitting with his parents(technically at the back seat). I am seriously pissed about this high level complications in immature white boys in UK and I blame the highly developed and market-oriented economic system for it. So, Reuben sang his own song 'Lifeline' beautifully I must say. But the most awesome part of this video is his girlfriend, she was eternally and simplistically gorgeous, you could see her in the back in the video. I mean, she is hot. I reverse searched her picture on google and found her through a 12 minute rigourous procedure of high-level social media stalking. I found many people asking her name. Her name is 'Emma Davis' and this is her Insta account (this link is only for educational purposes :|).

The Next person I searched is 'Lucy Spraggan'. This short and fat little girl sang her own songs 'Last night' and 'Tea and Toast' which I liked the most, her all songs revealed short stories. Lyrics of her songs, her classic UK accent and plucked strings created a vibrational atmosphere that I really enjoyed. Normally when I listen a song I don't give my full attention to it, I keep thinking other things (direct consequence is why I don't have many friends). Lyrics of the 'Tea and Toast' song is elegantly written and sang, I really recommened it a view, I am getting any share from it just to clear it out.
