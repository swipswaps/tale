I subscribed the youtube channels of **X-factor UK/USA and Got talent shows** a long time ago but recently I accidently watched one of audition-video and I was so intrigued of the vocals, it just fired up one of my neurons located at the craziest part of my brain, whose advice I most certainly like to take (He knows that!). Hence **_begin the 46-hrs hunt_** of all the possible audition videos, 6-chair auditions, boot camp, got talent singers, their past records and if their vocals are really relevant, I researched about them. In this Blog-post I'll tell my experience of some of the most gifted and well practised singers, some soulful song writers and brilliant stories about them that I found out.

I will try to put it as interestingly as possible and I think if you are music fan or soulful song appreciator or any random person surfing through internet then I guess this 8-minute read is for you.

The First person whose vocals I'm grateful to hear is ['Reuben Gray'](). This young 16-year old boy sang a song about an apology to his girlfriend when she dumped him BUT they patched up and she was sitting with his parents(at the back seat) during the audition. Here I'm seriously pissed about the highly-intellectual complications in immature white boys in UK and I blame the developed and market-oriented economic system for it. So, Reuben sang his own song ['Lifeline'](), beautifully I must say. But the most awesome part of this video is his **Girlfriend**, she was eternally and simplistically gorgeous, you could see her in the back in the video. I mean, she is hot. I reverse searched her picture on google and found her through a 12 minute rigourous procedure of high-level social media stalking. I found many people asking her name. Her name is **'Emma Davis'** and this is her [Insta account]() (this link is only for educational purposes :|).

The Next person I searched is ['Lucy Spraggan'](). This short and fat little girl sang her own songs ['Last night']() and ['Tea and Toast']() which I liked the most, her all songs revealed short stories. **Lyrics** of the songs, her **classic UK accent** and **plucked strings** created a vibrational atmosphere that I really enjoyed. Normally when I listen a song I don't give my full attention to it, I keep thinking other things (direct consequence is why I don't have many friends). Lyrics of the 'Tea and Toast' song is elegantly written and sang, I really recommened it a view, I am not getting any share from it, just to clear it out.
