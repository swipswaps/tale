Hey Guys! Particularly I'm intrigued by **Ideas**. Ideas that engulf the fear of excitement to the sense of a vision. Does that sound some overwhelming bragging to you? That was indeed. So let me say it clearly.


I like to get motivated by a spark of excitement and surprise about Ideas and materials. Maybe about the helixcally-twisted plot of a self-duplicating time-travelling movie, maybe the jazz music and graciously plucked strings of guitar of the 60's - 'You are my Sunshine', maybe the long coding sessions of a fairly simple problem, maybe the complicated mathematical calculations of the rotatory motion of heavenly bodies, maybe the 126Hz beat drop, maybe the girl standing around the corner in navy blue skirt at an overly-crowded restaurant, maybe the slow walk at 3 am under swiftly falling rain drops (Was that romantic?), maybe the head shot in CSGO from a far away sniper point, maybe about the infinite possible possibilities in the infinitly diverged multi-dimensional multiverse. As long as I live on Ideas, my illusion lies beside me. Maybe an old-fashioned barrier with a moderately healthy way to look at.

Was that a little-complicated way to express? Let me try to keep it **Describe myself in points**.

> 1. People tend to address me as **'Ankit Solanki'** or Daddy, I prefer both. 
> 2. I'm a **Computer Science** student in **IIT-Delhi**. 
>3. I am a **INTP** if you are familiar with 'MBTI' personality types.
> 4. I can explain to you why I am **Nihilistic** but does it even matter?
>5. Google test told me I am **Narcissistic**, I don't believe in it, people with low intelligence made that test. 


## Field that I'm explicitly interested in
1. **Psychology - through the fine line of Meta-physics and Spiritual Materialism**
2. **Financial Marketing and World Economy**
3. **Machine Learning - Artificial Intelligence**
4. **Psychological Thriller - Movies**
5. **Soft Classic, Hard Metal, R%B, hip hop - Music**


Well, I'll try to Bragg a little about myself and write generously on the beautiful experiences of my life. Stay tuned! you won't get bored for sure :)
