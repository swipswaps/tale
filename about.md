**Hey Guys!** Particularly I'm intrigued by **Ideas**. Ideas that engulf the fear of excitement to the sense of a vision. Does that sound some overwhelming bragging to you? That was indeed. So let me say it clearly.


I like to get motivated by a spark of excitement and surprise about Ideas and materials. Maybe about the helixcally-twisted plot of a self-duplicating time-travelling movie, maybe the jazz music and graciously plucked strings of guitar of the 60's - 'Runaround Sue', maybe the long coding sessions of a fairly simple problem, maybe the complicated mathematical calculations of the rotatory motion around heavenly bodies, maybe the 126Hz beat drop, maybe the girl with the straight hairs and big eyes standing around the corner in the navy blue skirt and 4-inch heels at an overly-crowded restaurant(That was my type of girl! If you seek to date me :P ), and maybe the slow walk at 3 am under swiftly falling rain drops (Does that sound romantic? Not to me!), maybe the head shot in CS-GO from a far away sniper point, maybe about the infinite possible possibilities in the infinitly diverged multi-dimensional multiverse. As long as I live, my illusion lies beside me. Maybe an old-fashioned barrier with a moderately healthy way to look at.

Was that a little-complicated way to express? Let me try to **describe myself in points**.

> 1. People tend to address me as **'Ankit Solanki'** or 'Daddy', I prefer both. 
> 2. I'm a **Computer Science** student pursuing **B.Tech+M.Tech** **IIT-Delhi**. 
>3. I am a **INTP/Logician**, if you are familiar with 'MBTI' personality types.
> 4. I can explain to you why I am **Nihilistic** but does it even matter?
>5. Google test told me I am **Narcissistic**, I don't believe in it, people with low intelligence made that test. 


## Field that I'm explicitly interested in
1. **Psychology - through the fine line of Meta-physics and Spiritual Materialism**
2. **Financial Marketing and World Economy**
3. **Machine Learning - Artificial Intelligence**
4. **DC Extended Universe**( Should have mentioned earlier )
5. **Soft Classic and Dramatical Thriller** ( A Guess for you! )


Well, I'll try to Bragg as little as possible about myself and write generously on the beautiful experiences of my life.

>**Stay tuned! you won't get bored for sure :D**
