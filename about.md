**Hola Amigo!**. My name is Ankit Solanki (As you'd have guessed by now, if you are not drunk or trapped within one of my clickbaits). This is my blog where I express about some **ideas** I get intrigued about. Some ideas that persumably engulf the fear of excitement to the sense of a vision through dimensions which we can't even see (Woah!). Does that sound some overwhelming bragging to you? That was indeed. So let me say it clearly.

I like to get motivated by a spark of excitement and surprise about ideas and non-materialistic things. Maybe about the helixcally-twisted plot of a time-travelling movie obeying the Heisenberg's set of rules, maybe the jazz music and graciously plucked strings of guitar in the 60's hit - 'Runaround Sue', maybe the long restless sessions on a fairly simple problem, maybe the complicated mathematical calculations of the rotatory motion across the bends of spacetime, maybe the 126.3Hz beat drop, maybe the girl with the straight black hairs and big eyes standing around the corner in Navy-blue skirt chained from the back wearing 4-inch heels at an overly-crowded restaurant (That was my type of girl! If you seek to date me :P; And love alert! I love Navy-blue, and maybe the slow walk at 3 am under the swiftly falling rain drops (Does that sound romantic?), maybe the ignorant use of maybe in one of the maybes used in this paragraph, maybe about the infinite possible possibilities in the infinitly diverged multi-dimensional multiverse. As long as I live, my illusion lies beside me. Maybe an old-fashioned barrier with a moderately healthy way to look at.
