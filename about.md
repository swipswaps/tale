Particularly I'm intrigued by **Ideas**. Ideas that generate excitement and a sense of creativity. Maybe about twisted plot of a Time-travelling movie, maybe the music of the 60's - 'Runaround Sue', maybe the functions implemented in Advanced data structures, maybe the astronomical calculations of the rotatory motion of heavenly bodies, maybe the 126Hz beat drop, maybe the girl standing around the corner in the overly-crowded restaurant, maybe the little walk at 3 am, maybe the corner goal in FIFA'17 with Magnus effect, maybe about the infinite possible possibilities in the infinite multiverse. As long as ideas will make me feel excited, I'll be more than happy to work on them and with them.


## Things that I interested to do-
1. **Psychology - through the fine line of Meta-physics and Spiritual Materialism**
2. **Financial Marketing and World Economy**
3. **Machine Learning - Aritifical Intelligence**
4. **Psychological Thriller - Movies**
5. **Soft Classic, Hard Metal, R%B, hip hop - Music**
